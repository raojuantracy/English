Then on Monday, Canadian Robert was retried and sentenced to death over `drug smuggling and drug trafficking` charges in a one-day trial in Dalian. Beijing has explicitly denied any links between Meng's situation and the legal action against Canadians in China, but the legal team for Robert said it was only after the Huawei arrest/apprehension that they started to see actions taken against their client. With the Chinese government **resolute 坚决 refusing** to go back down on the arrests and Canada unable to `interfere in` its country's independent legal system, there are now few options left to de-escalate the growing crisis.

#
e.g. The publication's editor, Hu Xijin, said in a video posted to its website in December that if Canada extradited Meng to the US, "China's revenge will be far worse than detaining a Canadian."
Most damning of all, the Chinese ambassador to Canada, Lu Shaye, wrote in an opinion piece published in early January that the arrests of the two Canadians -- ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor -- was "self-defense."
Ong said it wasn't just a sense of outrage driving the Communist Party leadership -- Beijing also wanted to appear tough at a time when it faced growing problems at home and abroad, including a slowing economy and a trade war with the United States.
"China doesn't want to look weak ... partially for domestic reasons it needs to assure its strong leadership. There are people in China who are unhappy with the arrest of Meng which is why (the government) has been very, very tough against Canada," she said.
But Ong said that in the process, Beijing has allowed the Meng case to blow out from a dispute between China and Canada to a broader one between China and the Western world.
As Hudson Institute senior fellow John Lee wrote for CNN on Wednesday, China is a "growing but lonely rising power" and can't afford to be estranging other countries so readily. "(China) is widely distrusted. It has few enduring allies and supporters. It could be bad faith or bad timing. But sentencing a Canadian to death has only raised collective suspicion and deepened its isolation," Lee wrote. In December, the US State Department also expressed concern over the detention of the two Canadians.

e.g. The **现任的 incumbent/sitting** Chinese President Xi and his government is anxious to ensure that the current trade talks with the United States are successful, hoping a deal will boost the country's flagging economy and **阻止遏制 stem consumer worries**. The desire for a quick deal with Washington to remove `trade tariffs` is part of why Beijing has been hammering Ottawa on Meng's detention -- despite the arrest/apprehension being a US request in the first place. However at this stage it appears more likely that China will simply keep trying to force Canada's hand ahead of Meng's trial in February. And if it doesn't get its way, this could **spell disaster for Schellenberg and his family**. "In a country such as China, where **there is no semblance of** the rule of law or the independence of the judiciary, there can be no fair trials, and this is why the death penalty is so **appalling  [ə'pɔlɪŋ] 骇人听闻的**," human rights advocate Michael Caster told CNN Tuesday. "In all cases -- but even more so when it is applied politically and as a threat to another country."

However, the implications of executing a Canadian-born Canadian citizen are clear, and raise important questions: Is Schellenberg's case an isolated example of **political retaliation/revenge 报复；复仇**, or does it hint at a new **precedent 先例；前例** in China of Western drug offenders facing the same treatment as those from the rest of the world? As China's economic and political might grows, the age of leniency for Westerners there just might have expired.
