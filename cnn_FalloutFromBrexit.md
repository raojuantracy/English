## （针对某个事件进行的;为表决某问题进行的)全民公决,全民投票 referendum [,rɛfə'rɛndəm], **pl: referenda referendums**

Some Labour MPs represent districts in Britain that voted `decisively 果断的，决断的` to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum, and fear losing their seats if there is a general election. But the party membership, which propelled Corbyn into power, strongly supports staying in the EU and has forced the leadership's position to evolve. Delegates at the party conference voted `overwhelmingly` for a motion that calls for a second `referendum` in the event that Parliament fails to approve an eventual deal. On Sunday, in an article for the Britain's Sunday Express newspaper, May `reiterated` her opposition to a new Brexit `referendum`. "Some are now openly advocating to `hold a second referendum on Brexit 就xxx进行全民公决` and extending Article 50 to delay Brexit" she wrote. Calls for a second referendum have increased since May returned from an informal EU summit in Salzburg, Austria last week and admitted discussions were **at an impasse  ['ɪmpæs]/pɑːs**   //**impasse /æmˈpɑːs/ If people are in a difficult position in which it is impossible to make any progress, you can refer to the situation as an impasse/deadlock/logjam/stalemate. 僵局**
