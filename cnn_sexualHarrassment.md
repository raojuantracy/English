## law pl: statute of limitations 限定法律行动有效时限的法令; 诉讼时效
Statutes of limitations are written laws passed by **a legislative body 司法机构** in common law systems to restrict the maximum time after an event that legal proceedings may be initiated. Once the period of time specified in **a statute of limitations** passes, a claim can no longer be validly filed. The intentions of these laws can facilitate the resolution in a reasonable amount of time. In **civil law** systems, similar provisions are typically part of the civil code or criminal code and are often known collectively as periods of prescription. There are very strict guidelines, but the cause of action dictates the statute of limitations on a civil case, where contracts, personal injury, libel and fraud cases legal or equitable remedy. These statutes can be reduced or extended to ensure a fair trial. Once a statute in a criminal actions case expires the court no longer has jurisdiction to punish the defendant.
•  The **statute of limitations** on crimes other than homicide is five years, so Reyes cannot be prosecuted for the attack.   除杀人罪以外的罪行的诉讼时效为5年，所以雷耶斯不能因为那次袭击被起诉。
