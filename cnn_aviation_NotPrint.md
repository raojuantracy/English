## wingspan /ˈwɪŋˌspæn/(鸟、昆虫或飞机的)翼展，翼幅〔指两翼展开时的宽度)
N-COUNT The wingspan of a bird, insect, or aeroplane is the distance from the end of one wing to the end of the other wing; the distance from the end of one wing to the end of the other 〕 (鸟、昆虫或飞机的)翼展，翼幅〔指两翼展开时的宽度)
•  ...a glider with an 18-foot wingspan.  ...一架翼幅为18英尺的滑翔机。
e.g.So you want a plane with huge `lift capability` and the `wingspan` to match, but you also need it to fit through regular airport gates. Once completed, the 777-9X is to have the widest `wingspan` of any aircraft in the company's 102-year history: 235 feet, five inches. Its `hinged wingtips (the point at the end of a bird’s or a plane’s wing〔鸟或飞机的〕翼尖，翼梢)` alone measure 12 feet, with locking pins to prevent them from folding during flight. The wings give the jetliner extra lift, similar to that of a giant sailplane glider, helping the plane to save an overall 12% more fuel than the Airbus A350. Now, you might have seen something similar on military aircraft -- such as the F/A-18 fighters which need to squeeze onto US `aircraft carriers` -- but when it comes to commercial planes this wing thing is the first of its kind.

e.g.So you want a plane with huge `lift capability` and the `wingspan` to match, but you also need it to fit through regular airport gates.

e.g. October's wing reveal follows `on the heels of` the "fully assembled" static 777-9X test plane being `rolled out` at the Everett facility in September. While it will never take to the skies, the aircraft is to undergo almost a year of `static testing` on the ground to verify the structural strength and accuracy of the design. Although the airframe of the `fuselage` is largely complete, it's missing some components, such as engines and `an avionics system`.

"Using a full-scale airplane, we'll run various load conditions on the wings, gears, the struts and the `fuselage`."
The wings have been tested at one-and-a-half-times the designated load during previous static tests, resulting in a wing flexing more than 26 feet.

Because of its size, it's a `demanding task (need lots of skill and tech)` for pilots to cope with `formidable challenges` of `maneuvering this plane`.

What emerged was the An-225 megaplane -- the biggest and most powerful airplane ever to successfully enter service.

Furthermore, when Ukraine was plunged into a revolution in 2014 that set it `at odds with Russia 与……不一致,与…争执`, it lost a key supplier of parts and equipment of the `gargantuan /ɡɑːˈɡæntjʊən/` aircraft, putting another question mark over the second An-225's future.

Silchenko says that while the company is still open for different options, the aircraft could be successfully put together and completed only in Kiev.

In 2010, it transported 110 tonnes of equipment, supplies, and provisions (food and water) to the Dominican Republic to help with relief efforts in neighboring Haiti after `a devastating earthquake`. `Needless to say`, Mriya has also come to the attention of Hollywood. A CGI-generated aircraft inspired by the An-225 appeared in sci-fi apocalypse movie "2012." A similar rendering starred alongside Vin Diesel in "Fast and Furious 6." The airplane also served as the inspiration for Jetstorm, a shape-shifting robot in the 2007 "Transformers" film. With performances like that, maybe an `encore` is overdue.
