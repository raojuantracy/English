# More than 250 people around the world have died taking selfies since 2011
https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/03/health/selfie-deaths-trnd/index.html

## take a selfie = snap a selfie 自拍，用手机或相机给自己拍照
e.g. `Snapping the perfect selfie` can be fun. But if it involves flying a plane or standing on slippery `steep/precipitous` rocks near the top of a waterfall, you may want to think twice. Some 259 people worldwide have died while `taking/snapping selfies`, according to a study published in the Journal. Researchers `scoured news reports 〔彻底地〕查找（文档，文件)` on selfie deaths that occurred from October 2011 to November 2017. They found that the most selfie deaths occurred in India. India `accounted for more than 50% of the total selfie deaths`. Researchers `attributed the high number to` the country's enormous population of people. Although women generally take more selfies than men, researchers found that men were more likely to take risks -- like standing at the edge of a `steep/precipitous` cliff -- to capture a dramatic shot. "It justifies the higher number of deaths and incidents for men," the study said.
