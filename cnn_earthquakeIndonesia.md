The volcano alert level was raised to three in Sulawesi following the eruption, two notches below the highest level on the Indonesian eruption scale. Authorities have laid out a danger zone within a four-kilometer radius, but so far there has been no need for evacuations.
But despite the volcano's relatively small impact, compared to Friday's disaster. some experts have questioned whether the two events could be directly related.
Scientists say that the devastating sequence of natural disasters was the result of a highly unusual series of geological events, which may be related to the eruption on Wednesday of the Soputan volcano.
"Did the bulging magma chamber of the volcano trigger the earthquake? Or did the earthquake trigger the magma chamber to pass magma to the funnel of the volcano?" said Costas Synolakis, director of the University of Southern California Tsunami Research Center.
According to Synolakis, volcanic eruptions are very often preceded by swarms of earthquakes, which are typically smaller than magnitude-5.
"It is all beginning to look like a Hollywood movie scenario," added Synokalis. "A (7.5-magnitude) earthquake with a mechanism not usually associated with tsunamis triggers a big one, and volcanic activity at a distance from the earthquake far larger than usually expected for causation."
