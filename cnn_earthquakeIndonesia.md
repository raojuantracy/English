## death toll  V.S. mortality rate (死亡率)
e.g. The `volcanic eruption` hasn't yet slowed rescue efforts in Palu, where Sutopo said authorities were only just within `the seven-day window` in which there is a chance that survivors "still exist." It gives rescue crews less than two days to finish `combing through rubbles 梳理;在xxx中搜寻` for possible `signs of life 生命迹象`. The `death toll` rised again on Wednesday, rising to 1,407 amid warnings from authorities that the casualty count is expected to rise even further as search efforts continue. In total, an estimated 2.4 million people have been `displaced 背井离乡` by the disasters.

e.g. But `a volcanic eruption [vɑl'kænɪk]` just north of the disaster zone, the third severe `tectonic event` in Indonesia in less than a week, has highlighted the difficult task facing authorities in the geographically unstable region. The volcano, Mount Soputan, in the northern part of the island of Sulawesi, `erupted` just before 8 a.m. on Wednesday. The `volcanic ash cloud` rose four kilometers high over the devastated island毁坏的, the originally `idyllic island  [aɪ'dɪlɪk] 田园一般的岛屿`, but so far the local airport still remains open and no evacuations have been required. Indonesia sits between two `continental plates` on what is known as the Ring of Fire, a band around the basin of the Pacific Ocean that leads to high levels of **tectonic and volcanic activity**. Wednesday's eruption isn't even the first `seismic event` to hit Indonesia following the devastating earthquake and tsunami on Friday. A separate 6.0-magnitude tremor struck the island of Sumba, close to Bali, on Tuesday morning

The volcano alert level was raised to three in Sulawesi following the eruption, two notches below the highest level on the Indonesian eruption scale. Authorities have laid out a danger zone within a four-kilometer radius, but so far there has been no need for evacuations.
But despite the volcano's relatively small impact, compared to Friday's disaster. some experts have questioned whether the two events could be directly related.
Scientists say that the devastating sequence of natural disasters was the result of a highly unusual series of geological events, which may be related to the eruption on Wednesday of the Soputan volcano.
"Did the bulging magma chamber of the volcano trigger the earthquake? Or did the earthquake trigger the magma chamber to pass magma to the funnel of the volcano?" said Costas Synolakis, director of the University of Southern California Tsunami Research Center.
According to Synolakis, volcanic eruptions are very often preceded by swarms of earthquakes, which are typically smaller than magnitude-5.
"It is all beginning to look like a Hollywood movie scenario," added Synokalis. "A (7.5-magnitude) earthquake with a mechanism not usually associated with tsunamis triggers a big one, and volcanic activity at a distance from the earthquake far larger than usually expected for causation."
