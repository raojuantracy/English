 # CNN excerpt
 Dozens of people have died across Japan as the country continues to swelter under scorching summer temperatures酷热的温度. In Kumagaya, a prefecture(日本〕县 near Tokyo, the mercury/ˈmɜːkjʊrɪ/
 thermometer rose to 41.1 degrees (105.98F), the unprecedentedly/all-time high record in Japan, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency, almost 12 degrees hotter than average temperatures at this time of year.

 It is these types of searing heat waves灼热 that scientists have been warning would be a consequence of warming the planet through greenhouse gas emissions. "The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle," said a climate scientist. "We are seeing them play out in real time in the form of unprecedented searing heat waves, floods, droughts and wildfires. And we've seen them all this summer," he said.

 In Northern Africa's Sahara Desert, certainly no stranger to sweltering temperatures, a record high was recorded July 5 in Ouargla, Algeria. The mark of 51.3 C (124 F) is the highest temperature ever reliably recorded on the African continent, according to the World Meteorological Organization.
 This month, a brutal heat wave also struck Canada, which saw temperatures peak in Montreal on July 2 with a record of 36.6 C (98 F). CNN's news partner CBC reported that the number of deaths overwhelmed Montreal's morgue(A morgue is a building or a room in a hospital where dead bodies are kept before they are buried or cremated, or before they are identified or examined. 停尸房).

 In the United States, July searing heat waves灼热 have stretched from the highly populated Northeast to the desert Southwest. An exceptional stretch of heat in Dallas-Fort Worth has brought four consecutive days (4 days in a row) with record highs, hitting 108 or 109 F each day (42 to 43 C).

 "But today, climate change is loading the dice against[古语]事先注定某事结果，预先决定成败(或胜负) us, making certain types of extremes, such as searing heat waves灼热 and heavy rain events, much more frequent and more intense than they used to be," Hayhoe said. Well, here it is. And this is what it looks like. Although it will still get cold during the winter and there will be colder-than-normal spells from time to time, the heat will return, and summers are getting hotter.
