2. The gloves are off now (脱掉手套)来玩真的吧; 对决要开始了

e.g. Under the Obama administration, the US `indicted Chinese personnel for` similar charges, but was reluctant to take more drastic action such as arresting the individuals in third countries, over fear that Beijing would `retaliate/revenge against` US interests in China or in other countries.

What happens next to Meng, the daughter of Huawei's reclusive founder, could have `huge repercussions /ˌriːpəˈkʌʃən/` for the US-China relationship and Huawei's business.   //**repercussion /ˌriːpəˈkʌʃən/ If an action or event has repercussions, it causes unpleasant things to happen some time after the original action or event. 后果 = the bad or unpleasant fallout from something**

e.g. Balding pointed out that the `truce/armistice` deal was reached the same day that Meng was arrested in Canada. "That is very politically embarrassing to Xi = It seems that Xi **was held in contempt**," he said. "It has to be considered an escalation of the trade war/skirmish/spat口角 between China and U.S.."
e.g. Mark Zuckerberg and his colleagues were `apparently` concerned enough about Vine, a video app from Twitter, that on the day it launched in January 2013, they moved to restrict its access to Facebook user data, a `trove` of internal Facebook emails released by the U.K. Parliament on Wednesday shows. The decision to restrict Vine's access to data, which `would have allowed (subjunctive mood)` its users to invite their Facebook friends to join the app, `was in line with` a company policy at the time. The email discussion about Vine is part of `a trove of internal Facebook documents` the company fought to keep secret. The documents include conversations among senior Facebook executives. A California judge had placed the documents `under seal`. But when Six4Three's CEO was in London last month, he was escorted to Parliament and told to produce the documents or `his company would be held in contempt`.

## prelude
e.g. American officials have repeatedly alleged that the Chinese government could use Huawei products for `espionage` — claims the company denies. Meng's case could be a `prelude` to further action against the firm and its senior officials," Eurasia Group analysts said. Huawei's smaller rival,ZTE, provides an example of how the US government could go further. The Chinese company `was crippled = seriously damaged 严重损坏[削弱]` for months after the US Commerce Department `imposed a blanket ban on it` and blocked it from buying vital parts from American companies. The ban threatened to put ZTE out of business and highlighted China's continued reliance on American technology, a vulnerability Beijing is eager to reduce. ZTE eventually `got a reprieve 缓期执行；暂时解救` after Xi personally asked Trump for help.   //**to damage something badly so that it no longer works or is no longer effective 严重损坏[削弱]**

The US Justice Department declined to comment Wednesday. "The company has been provided very little information regarding the charges and is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng," the spokesperson said. "The company believes the Canadian and US legal systems will ultimately reach a just conclusion. Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU."

## It's through that lens
e.g. `It's through that lens that` some in the Chinese government view the arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, at the request of US authorities. "The US is trying to do whatever it can to contain Huawei's expansion in the world simply because the company is `the point man 领头人物; 领军人物` for China's competitive technology companies," said an editorial Thursday in `state-run newspaper` China Daily. China's `tech aspirations` have `garnered concern` in the United States for years — especially because Beijing's goals are seen as relying on the **misappropriation [,mɪsə,prəʊprɪ'eɪʃn]  [,mɪsə,proprɪ'eʃən] 侵吞；滥用** of American technology. President Donald Trump has tried to tackle these issues directly. His administration says that the hundreds of billions of dollars in `tariffs it's slapped/imposed on` Chinese goods are part of an effort to stop China from stealing US tech.

e.g. The Meng case, then, **has major ramifications**. The US government claims that Meng covered up violations of sanctions on Iran, according to Canadian prosecutors, who spoke at Meng's bail保释 hearing in Vancouver on Friday. Whether Huawei itself faces legal trouble remains to be seen, though there's `speculation/conjecture 推测；猜想` that the company could receive an export ban due to sanctions violations like the one imposed on ZTE. Such a ban, if `enacted`, would be `catastrophic [,kætə'strɑfɪk]` for the company — and would `derail Beijing's plans` to deploy 5G on a large commercial scale by 2020. "The arrest of Huawei's CFO in Canada will significantly `raise the stakes` of China's 5G timing, since any US export ban imposed on Huawei could either delay China's 5G `rollout`, or significantly reduce the scale near term."
