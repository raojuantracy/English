## touch down: PHRASAL VERB When an aircraft touches down, it lands. 着陆
•  The space shuttle touched down yesterday.   这架航天飞机昨日着陆。
e.g. Just a little while ago, I was on the complete other side of the planet. After `touching down` at New Jersey's Newark Liberty International airport outside New York -- completing the inaugural journey of the longest flight in the world -- I can tell you this: It was an unforgettable night ... followed by a day ... followed by another night.
In about 17 hours and 25 minutes, we flew from Singapore halfway around the globe `nonstop` aboard Singapore Airlines Flight SQ22 -- now the most ultra of ultra-long-haul routes. It was a little bit of a travel `endurance  [ɪn'dʊrəns] test 耐久性试验疲劳试验持久试验` for everyone on board -- passengers and crew, including captain, first officers, and `flight attendants (FA)`. The `sheer achievement`, mechanical and human, to make it happen -- amazing!

e.g Marketed toward business travelers globally, the Singapore airline, SQ22, spans 10,377 miles `give or take/or so/more or less`, depending on the exact `flight path/route`. `Cruising at around 41,000 feet` at about 575 mph, the `flight route/path` was made possible by a new, super-efficient twin `turbofan engine 涡轮风扇喷气发动` Airbus A350 jet that `seats 161 passengers`. Also on board at takeoff: 111 tonnes of fuel (which means it's such a **gas guzzler 很能吃油/耗油的车/飞机**). In addition to checking out the new jet, we experimented with new gadgets aimed at maximizing sleep and minimizing `jet lag` //**lag behind; jet lag; turbine /ˈtɜːbɪn, -baɪn/ A turbine is a machine or engine which uses a stream of air, gas, water, or steam to turn a wheel and produce power. 涡轮机; turbofan engines**

## (声音)分贝 decibel /ˈdɛsɪˌbɛl/
N-COUNT A decibel is a unit of measurement which is used to indicate how loud a sound is. 分贝
e.g.  Continuous exposure to sound above 80 decibels could be harmful.  持续曝露于超过80分贝的声音可能有害。
e.g. This is a revolution in aviation. These new `sophisticated高尖端的/精密的` twin `turbofan engine` airliners like Boeing's 787 - they're designed to make ultralong routes like this one profitable. Most surprising about this plane was the smoothness. And it was so much quieter than we expected. In fact, we were told the average `decibel /ˈdɛsɪˌbɛl/ `level was 80-85 `decibels /ˈdɛsɪˌbɛl/`. But in business class it actually was lower: around 70 decibels.

## blackout /ˈblækaʊt/    
1. N-COUNT A blackout is a period of time during a war in which towns and buildings are made dark so that they cannot be seen by enemy planes. (战时为防止空袭而实施的) 灯火管制期

e.g. `The in-flight entertainment` and Wi-Fi on the flight was good. In fact, we had been told there would be a significant **Wi-Fi blackout 无信号的死角** on board at some point during the flight because of the `flight route/path/track` we were flying, but the **Wi-Fi blackout** was never as long as we anticipated. We were able to live blog and post to social media most of the flight. FAs are encouraging passengers to watch the `Hollywood blockbusters` of the week. And what such an `unforgettable` journey it was!

## 风标,风向标　windsock /ˈwɪndˌsɒk/
N-COUNT A windsock is a device, consisting of a tube of cloth mounted on a pole, normally `in cylindrical shape圆柱体的`, that is used at airports and airfields to indicate the direction and force of the wind. 风标,风向标

e.g. The plane was `deafeningly/ˈdɛfənɪŋ/` noisy, `fuel-guzzling`, and left a trail of smoke.  这架飞机噪音震耳，费油
e.g. Unlike the previous route between Newark (EWR) and Singapore (SIN), which was flown with `gas-guzzling` four `turnbofan` engined A340-500s, I believe this route will be profitable and is here to stay because this new Airbus is 25% more `fuel efficient 节能的, 节约能源的` then the previous aircraft. In fact, we landed with 8 tonnes of fuel left in the airplane fuel tanks, after taking off with 111 tonnes. Albeit we did have a nice tailwind pushing us along. Flying the opposite direction -- from Newark to Singapore, will burn more fuel.

## amenity /əˈmiːnɪtɪ/, amenities

I won't know if they helped until later, because I've been awake **in the wee hours (the early hours of the morning, just after 12 o’clock at night
凌晨〔午夜后不久〕** and I only got about five hours of sleep on the flight.  
e.g Marketed toward business travelers globally, the Singapore airline, SQ22, spans 10,377 miles `give or take/or so/more or less`, depending on the exact `flight path/route`. `Cruising at around 41,000 feet` at about 575 mph, the `flight route/path` was made possible by a new, super-efficient twin `turbofan engine 涡轮风扇喷气发动` Airbus A350 jet that `seats 161 passengers`.

e.g. There were four possible tracks we could have taken across the Pacific to New York via the Great Circle Route, as it's called, which takes you north over Alaska. Because of the prevailing `tailwinds` during our flight, the track we followed took us in a northerly direction staying east of China, east of Japan, east of Russia and making landfall into Alaska and northern Canada, before turning more south toward New York.

V-T To mitigate something means to make it less unpleasant, serious, or painful. 缓解/减轻(伤痛，悲伤)

e.g. I used a couple of gadgets designed to help with **jet lag**, just to **mitigate/alleviate 缓和/减轻** the effect of **jet lag** -- special eyeglasses and a wrist band. I won't know if they helped until later, because I've been awake **in the wee hours (the early hours of the morning, just after 12 o’clock at night

In fact, we had been told there would be a significant **Wi-Fi blackout 无信号的死角** on board at some point during the flight because of the `flight route/path/track` we were flying, but the **Wi-Fi blackout** was never as long as we anticipated. We were able to live blog and post to social media most of the flight. FAs are encouraging passengers to watch the `Hollywood blockbusters` of the week. And what such an `unforgettable` journey it was!

## guzzle sth; guzzle gas/fuel/petrol; a gas guzzler/a fuel guzzler

e.g. The plane was `deafeningly/ˈdɛfənɪŋ/` noisy, `guzzled fuel`, and left a trail of smoke.  这架飞机噪音震耳，费油
e.g. `Seating 350 to 425 passengers`, the airliner `is due to` `debut首秀` in 2020, with test flights beginning next year. Boeing's new family comes as part of an engineering revolution allowing jetliners with only two `turbofan engines` to take on many of the same global routes as larger, `fuel-guzzling` four-engine airliners such as the 747 Super Jumbo.
e.g. Unlike the previous route between Newark (EWR) and Singapore (SIN), which was flown with `gas-guzzling` four `turnbofan` engined A340-500s, I believe this route will be profitable and is here to stay because this new Airbus is 25% more `fuel efficient 节能的` then the previous aircraft. In fact, we landed with 8 tonnes of fuel left in the airplane fuel tanks, after taking off with 111 tonnes. Albeit we did have a nice tailwind pushing us along. Flying the opposite direction -- from Newark to Singapore, will burn more fuel.
