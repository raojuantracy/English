Fire at Notre Dame Cathedral

# Notre Dame Cathedral 巴黎圣母院/ˈnəʊtrə ˈdɑːm/
N the early Gothic cathedral of Paris, on the Île de la Cité: built between 1163 and 1257
e.g. In a time of heightened political, religious and `sectarian [sɛk'tɛrɪən] 宗派的` divisions, a fire in the `Notre Dame Catholic cathedral` in France brought the world together in shared sorrow, writes CNN's world affairs `columnist`, Frida Ghitis. “The massive, `majestic cathedral` looked like it had been there forever, and would remain until the end of time. If only for a moment, `Notre Dame /ˈnəʊtrə ˈdɑːm/` ablaze reminded us that we all share this world; that human history means everyone's past." "If only for a moment, the notion of a 'World Heritage,' which UNESCO formally `bestows` on places that we, as humanity, ought to care for and cherish so that we can pass them to future generations, seemed exactly right. We all hurt over the loss of Notre Dame.”
e.g. We **are so devastated by this tragedy**: A massive blaze at `Notre Dame Cathedral /ˈnəʊtrə ˈdɑːm/` in Paris devastated large parts of the 850-year-old church on Monday evening.
