# majesty
e.g. The former US first lady, who is in Paris for her book tour, has tweeted about the "majesty" of the cathedral, which is one of the city's most `recognizable and visited attractions`. The majesty of Notre Dame—the history, artistry, and spirituality—took our breath away, lifting us to a higher understanding of who we are and who we can be. Being here in Paris tonight, my heart aches with the people of France. Yet I know that Notre Dame will soon awe us again.
